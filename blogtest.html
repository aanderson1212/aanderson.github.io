        <p>I started working on this website not only to improve my html and css but<br>i'd love to have like minded friends and to be in a web-ring with them :></p>
        <p>As silly as it is i love the idea of web-rings and like that kind of group of people who code/work together<br>idk maybe im romanticizing it but it does sound rlly fun doing that through college</p>
        <p>Overall my goals with this website is fixing a LOT of formatting issues and general bugs with the layouts<br>and the addition of a guestbook or something similar.</p>
        <p><br>It's probably easy to guess but i absolutely love the old school websites from the late 90's and early 2000s<br>namely <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities" style="margin-left: -1px;" target="_blank">Geocities,</a></span> something about the layouts and gifs and overall feel<br>that really gets me, it makes me nostalgic for an era i was not apart of</p>
        <p><br>I think that about does it for this, i'll keep working on this, always feel free<br>to message me on discord :3</p>
